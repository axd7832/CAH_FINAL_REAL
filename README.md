Cards Against Humanity is a popular card game in which the players take turns to create the funniest possible combination of the cards.
This program works to recreate the gameplay. Users first connect, and then are dealt cards. When there are 4 players, the game begins and
the players may choose the best card from their hand to send to the "Card Master" AKA the person judging all the other players cards.
The Card Master then decides who has the funniest cards, and then points are awarded to that player accordingly.

If you would like to test run this program:
Download the Jar files: CardsServer.jar AND CardsClient.jar
In a command line terminal with JAVA installed run: -java jar CardsServer.jar
CardsClient.jar can be run by double clicking on the icon in the folder that you downloaded it in. (Or also in the terminal)
